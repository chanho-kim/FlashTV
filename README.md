An application to help communication between stage manager and performer

This was my first project I decided to start on my own.
At the time I didn't have a clear understanding of Object-Oriented Programming or a good coding practice,
so the code might look dirty and unorganized. But as for the functionality, the application is usable.
I plan to come back to this project later to clean up the code and re-structure for better organization.
